# rust-opengl-triangle
Learning Rust + OpenGL

1) Went through [Nercury/rust-and-opengl-lessons](https://github.com/Nercury/rust-and-opengl-lessons) 01-13
2) Replaced [sdl2](https://crates.io/crates/sdl2) with [glutin](https://crates.io/crates/glutin) - much faster build times and no need for DLL structre in project and extra lines in build.rs.
